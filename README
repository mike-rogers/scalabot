Introduction
------------------------------

This is a simple irc bot written in scala.

Right now it has six commands:
    1. The "%pom" command will output the phase of the mooon.
    2. The "%crime" command will randomize two superheroes known for crimefighting.
    3. The "%calc" command will try to execute the remainder of the privmsg as an RPN statement.
    4. The "%roll" command will roll a certain number of dice. For example, 2d4 will add 2 four-sided dice.
    5. The "%stock" command will return the current stock value for a given ticker symbol.
    6. The "%tweet" command. See 'Configuring the Tweet Command' for more information.

------------------------------
Configuration
------------------------------

To configure, have a file called 'config.xml' in the root of your classpath. Mine looks like this:

<server name="freenode"
        url="irc.freenode.net"
        nick="your_nick_here"
        identify="your_nickserv_pass_here">
    <channel name="#test_channel"/>
</server>

You can add as many channels as you wish.

------------------------------
Compiling and Running
------------------------------

Prior to your first compilation, you will need to install the PircBot library in Maven. To do this, download the library from http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php, unzip, and run the following command:

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=pircbot-1.5.0/pircbot.jar -DgroupId=pircbot -DartifactId=pircbot -Dversion=1.5.0 -Dpackaging=jar

I compile with: mvn assembly:assembly

I run with: java -cp target/scalabot-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.cansado.scalabot.ScalaBot

------------------------------
Configuring the Tweet Command
------------------------------

The %tweet command is intended to be a gateway from an IRC channel to a single Twitter account. Right now you can only post to the Twitter account from IRC.

To configure the %tweet command, you'll need to register an account with Twitter. You'll then need to log in to this new account and visit http://twitter.com/apps/new to register this bot as a new application. This will get you your 'consumerKey' and 'consumerSecret'.

Then you'll need to compile the application per 'Compiling and Running', and run with: java -cp target/scalabot-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.cansado.scalabot.twitter.Configurator

When prompted, enter your consumerKey and consumerSecret. You will then be asked to visit a URL. Go there and 'approve' the application. You'll be presented with a PIN, which you will then need to enter at the Configurator prompt.

The Configurator will spit out your 'tokenKey' and 'tokenSecret'. You now have everything you need to configure the %tweet command. Here's a sample config.xml:

<server name="server-identifier"
	url="server.url"
	nick="bot-nickname">
  <channel name="#yourchannel">
    <twitter name="twitter-name"
	     consumerKey="consumerKey"
	     consumerSecret="consumerSecret"
	     tokenKey="tokenKey"
	     tokenSecret="tokenSecret"/>
  </channel>
</server>

If you have any questions, feel free to add to the wiki or do whatever. I don't know github yet.
