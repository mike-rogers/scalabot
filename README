This is a simple irc bot written in scala.

Right now it does two things:
    1. When a user prefixes her privmsg with "%pom" the ScalaBot will output the position of the moon.
    2. When a user prefixes her privmsg with "%crime" the ScalaBot will randomize two superheroes known for crimefighting.

To configure, have a file called 'config.xml' in the root of your classpath. Mine looks like this:

<server name="freenode"
        url="irc.freenode.net"
        nick="your_nick_here"
        identify="your_nickserv_pass_here">
    <channel name="#test_channel"/>
</server>

You can add as many channels as you wish.

I compile with: mvn assembly:assembly

I run with: java -classpath target/scalabot-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.cansado.scalabot.ScalaBot

If you have any questions, feel free to add to the wiki or do whatever. I don't know github yet.
