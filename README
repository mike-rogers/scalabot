This is a simple irc bot written in scala.

Right now it does two things:
    1. When a user prefixes her privmsg with "%pom" the ScalaBot will output the position of the moon.
    2. When a user prefixes her privmsg with "%crime" the ScalaBot will randomize two superheroes known for crimefighting.

To configure, have a file called 'config.xml' in the root of your classpath. Mine looks like this:

<server name="freenode"
        url="irc.freenode.net"
        nick="your_nick_here"
        identify="your_nickserv_pass_here">
    <channel name="#test_channel"/>
</server>

You can add as many channels as you wish.

Prior to your first compilation, you will need to install the PircBot library in Maven. To do this, download the library from http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php, unzip, and run the following command:

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=pircbot-1.5.0/pircbot.jar -DgroupId=pircbot -DartifactId=pircbot -Dversion=1.5.0 -Dpackaging=jar

I compile with: mvn assembly:assembly

I run with: java -classpath target/scalabot-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.cansado.scalabot.ScalaBot

If you have any questions, feel free to add to the wiki or do whatever. I don't know github yet.
